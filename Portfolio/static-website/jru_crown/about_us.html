<p><h3>ABOUT José Rizal University (JRU)</h3>Formerly José Rizal College / JRC is a non-sectarian, 
non-stock private educational institution. It is located at Shaw Boulevard, Mandaluyong City,
 Philippines. It was founded in 1919 by Vicente Fabella, who was the first Philippine Certified Accountant.
 It has since blazed a trail in commercial education and continued to break new ground in various fields by combining advancements in teaching methodology and information technology to provide students with basic tools that will prepare and equip them to succeed in today’s rapidly changing technological world as well as develop their personal and intellectual qualities.

JRU has established strong ties with universities both here and abroad to facilitate on-going cultural exchange and faculty dialogue and collaborations. Partnerships with major industry players for curriculum development ensure that students are exposed to the standards and demands of industry.

To this day, the University continues to build on its foundation of academic excellence through a roster of topnotch 
faculty, superior facilities, and well-planned programs in various disciplines that have received numerous accreditations.
 As a testament to its commitment and contribution to the promotion of quality education, JRU has recently been granted Autonomous
  Status by the Commission on Higher Education (Resolution No. 013-2009 dated October 6, 2009). Only two percent of the academic 
  institutions in the country have accomplished this and 15 come from the National Capital Region. In addition, the University has
   also maintained its deregulated status since 2001, a distinction only 50 universities in the Philippines have achieved.</p>

<p><h3>FACILITIES AND LOCATION</h3>            Jose Rizal University is located at No. 80 Shaw Boulevard, Mandaluyong City, 
accessible through many public transport lines passing directly in front of, and around 
the school. Shaw Boulevard is a first-class asphalted national road, so that the dust pro-
blem is non-existent.

        The University itself occupies an area comprising one-and-a-half city blocks located 
on high commanding ground bordered by a wall. Located inside this spacious campus are 
modern,  well-design,  concrete multi-story  buildings;  air-conditioned classrooms,  and 
surrounded by shade trees and green lawns  

         The air-conditioned main library is a glass-enclosed structure occupies the ground and
second floor of a 5-storey building fronting Shaw Boulevard. It contains a collection of over  
110,000 titles in electronic and print form, and is fully wi-fi enabled and computerized. Stu-
dents are encouraged to browse the collections on the shelves, or by using library computer 
stations or laptops, their personal laptops, or their smartphone. A similarly-equipped library 
in the eight-storey Tower Building is for use of the graduate and law students.

            The auditorium is housed in the ground floor of  five-storey building completed in 1995.
The laboratory rooms,the engineering laboratories,the nursing skills laboratories and the speech
laboratory are also located in this building.

        Adjoining the main campus and seperated by an asphalted city road is an annex campus of
about a half city block which is connected to the main campus by a concrete covered pedestrian 
overpass. The campus which is covered entirely by a steel structure, contains primarily athletic
and physical education facilitie, and a six-storey concrete building, completed in 2008, purposely
designed for classrooms and offices.
