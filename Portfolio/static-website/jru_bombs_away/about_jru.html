<h2>JOS&#201 RIZAL UNIVERSITY - About</h2>
<p>Jose Rizal University (JRU) prides itself for being among the most inexpensive 
private universities in the country that offers quality education. It is a non-stock, 
non-profit, non-sectarian private educational institution founded in 1919 by Don Vicente
 Fabella based on the ideal of good education available to all.
 It has since blazed a trail in commercial education and continued to break new 
 ground in various fields by combining advancements in teaching methodology and 
 information technology to provide students with basic tools that will prepare and
  equip them to succeed in today's rapidly changing technological world as well as 
  develop their personal and intellectual qualities.<br /><br />

JRU has established strong ties with universities both here and abroad
 to facilitate on-going cultural exchange and faculty dialogue and collaborations. 
 Partnerships with major industry players for curriculum development ensure that students 
 are exposed to the standards and demands of industry.<br /><br />

To this day, the University continues to build on its foundation of 
academic excellence through a roster of topnotch faculty, superior facilities, and 
well-planned programs in various disciplines that have received numerous accreditations. 
As a testament to its commitment and contribution to the promotion of quality education, JRU
 has recently been granted Autonomous Status by the Commission on Higher Education (Resolution No. 
 013-2009 dated October 6, 2009). Only two percent of the academic institutions in the country have 
 accomplished this and 15 come from the National Capital Region. In addition, the University has also 
 maintained its deregulated status since 2001, a distinction only 50 universities in the Philippines have achieved.</p>
